## 📚 Topics Covered

### Arrays
- **Concatenation of Arrays** - Combining multiple arrays into a single array
- **Product of Array Except Self** - Computing the product of all elements except the current element using prefix and suffix multiplication

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master fundamental data structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- Understand key algorithm paradigms (Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Divide & Conquer, etc.)
- Develop problem-solving skills through hands-on implementations
- Optimize code for time and space complexity

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Navigate to the desired topic folder
2. Review the implementation files
3. Run examples:
   ```bash
   python3 Products_Of_Array.py
   ```

## 💡 Key Concepts

- **Time Complexity**: Analyze how runtime grows with input size
- **Space Complexity**: Evaluate memory usage of algorithms
- **Optimization**: Trade-offs between speed and memory

## 📖 Resources

- Study each implementation to understand the approach
- Comments in code explain the logic step-by-step
- Modify and experiment with different inputs

## ✨ Features

- Clean, readable code with detailed comments
- Multiple approaches to common problems
- Example test cases for each solution
